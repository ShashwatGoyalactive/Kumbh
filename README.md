# Mahakumbh Crowd Management AI System

## Overview

The Mahakumbh is one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, attracting millions of devotees to a single location. While it is an event of devotion and unity, the massive crowd poses significant challenges in terms of safety and movement coordination. Traditional crowd management methods often struggle to respond effectively to congestion and panic situations. This project aims to develop a full-stack web and AI/ML-powered solution to enhance crowd safety and optimize movement in real time.

## Features

### 1. AI-based Crowd Density Monitoring & Prediction

- Uses computer vision and AI models to analyze live footage from CCTV and drones.
- Provides real-time crowd density heatmaps.
- Predicts potential overcrowding zones based on historical and live data.

### 2. Real-time Crowd Flow Optimization & Route Suggestions

- Dynamically suggests the best movement paths to avoid congestion.
- Uses real-time data from IoT sensors, mobile apps, and AI models.
- Provides optimized route recommendations to authorities and the public.

### 3. AI-driven Panic & Stampede Detection System

- Detects unusual crowd movements and behaviors using AI-powered anomaly detection.
- Sends instant alerts to authorities for rapid intervention.
- Uses deep learning to analyze patterns of panic and predict potential stampede situations.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:

- React.js (for a dynamic and responsive UI)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

### Backend:

- Node.js with Express (for API development)
- WebSockets (for real-time updates)

### AI/ML Components:

- OpenCV & Deep Learning (for computer vision-based crowd analysis)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (for ML model training & inference)
- YOLO or similar object detection models (for crowd density estimation)

### Database:

- PostgreSQL (for structured data storage)
- Redis (for caching real-time data)

### Deployment:

- Docker & Kubernetes (for containerization and scalability)
- AWS/GCP/Azure (for cloud hosting and real-time processing)

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Real-time video feeds, mobile GPS data, and IoT sensor inputs are ingested.
2. **AI Processing**: Machine learning models analyze the data for crowd density, movement patterns, and anomalies.
3. **Decision Making**: The system provides optimized routes, alerts authorities about potential risks, and offers predictive insights.
4. **Action & Alerts**: Authorities and users receive real-time updates via a web interface and mobile notifications.

## Installation & Setup
